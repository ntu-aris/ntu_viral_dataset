# Sensor Calibration


Sensor intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations are some of the most critical factors in getting the higher quality results in the process, such as stereo matching, SLAM, fusion. However, there are different coefficients and models that one can choose and opt to use in the algorithm. In this section, we aim to provide a sample on how to do the calibration with a different choice of coefficients.
