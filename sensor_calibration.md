# Sensor Calibration


Sensor intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations are some of the most critical factors in getting the higher quality results in the process, such as stereo matching, SLAM, fusion. However, there are different coefficients and models(atan, pinhole, etc.) that one can choose and opt to use in the algorithm. This section aims to provide a sample on how to do the calibration with a different choice of coefficients in this section. 

You can download our calibration datasets for stereo and inertial sensors from the [github repo](https://github.com/ntu-aris/viral_eval).

## calibrate_mono.py


```python 
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv
import glob
# termination criteria
criteria = (cv.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS + cv.TERM_CRITERIA_MAX_ITER, 30, 0.001)
# prepare object points, like (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0) ....,(6,5,0)
objp = np.zeros((6*7,3), np.float32)
objp[:,:2] = np.mgrid[0:7,0:6].T.reshape(-1,2)
# Arrays to store object points and image points from all the images.
objpoints = [] # 3d point in real world space
imgpoints = [] # 2d points in image plane.
images = glob.glob('*.jpg')
for fname in images:
    img = cv.imread(fname)
    gray = cv.cvtColor(img, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # Find the chess board corners
    ret, corners = cv.findChessboardCorners(gray, (7,6), None)
    # If found, add object points, image points (after refining them)
    if ret == True:
        objpoints.append(objp)
        corners2 = cv.cornerSubPix(gray,corners, (11,11), (-1,-1), criteria)
        imgpoints.append(corners)
        # Draw and display the corners
        cv.drawChessboardCorners(img, (7,6), corners2, ret)
        cv.imshow('img', img)
        cv.waitKey(500)
cv.destroyAllWindows()
```
